# The Dogeshit Manifesto

A meme has simultaneously captured the hearts of the public and billions
of dollars – Dogecoin. Wealthy powers of corporate interest have
coalesced to leverage the public’s love of this technology for their own
financial successes: Elon Musk, Mark Cuban, Robinhood, and AMC Theaters.

Where are the advancements in the Dogecoin technology from the massive
retail investment driven by these corporate powers? What happened to the
founding ethos, to bring the ability to participate in blockchain
networks to everyday individuals while rejecting the speculative nature
of cryptocurrencies? Where are the organic community contributions that
funded the Jamaican bobsled team’s trip to the Sochi Winter Olympics,
funded building a well in the Tana river basin in Kenya, and raised
enough to completely cover all of the stolen funds of Dogewallet users?

Two things result from this fact:

1.  Control of Dogecoin’s value has already been captured by corporate
    powers.
2.  It is high time that Dogecoin returns to its founding ethos,
    prioritizing the community of individuals who were passionate about
    blockchain technology but couldn’t participate due to prohibitive
    cost of entry, before corporate raiders have the opportunity to
    undermine the aging technology at the expense of the community.

To this end, I’ve created Dogeshit, a set of Solidity contracts that aim
to bring the value of the Dogecoin community into a proof of stake
ecosystem based around the following 4 major design choices:

1.  1 Dogecoin **→** 1 Dogeshit
2.  Just as Dogecoin was **not pre-mined**, Dogeshit is **not
    pre-minted**
3.  Keep the numbers **–nice–**
4.  “To be clear, I strongly believe in crypto, but it can’t drive a
    massive increase in fossil fuel use, especially coal”
    <sup>[\[1\]](#1)</sup>  
    “Ideally, Doge speeds up block time 10X, increases block size 10X &
    drops fee 100X. Then it wins hands down.” <sup>[\[2\]](#2)</sup>

## ‘Shitcoin’ – A Primer

The term ‘shitcoin’ has been term that has been lobbed at projects for a
number of reasons: low market capitalization, a lack of purpose besides
financial speculation, or a low effort fork of an existing project. The
meaning is pretty straightforward, these projects are ‘shitcoins’
because they’re worthless. It’s pretty obvious to say that ‘shit’ is
worthless, right?

Well, not so fast. In the context of consumers buying commercial
products, virtually no one is going to want to pay for shit; in fact,
many people pay for sewer service specifically to get rid of their shit.
Corporate stocks are an extension of this; instead of buying a product
though, we’re talking about buying part of a company that sells a
product. In this case, something begins to emerge; if the company sold
organic fertilizer to farmers, all of a sudden there appears to be a
case where shit is valuable.

Shit doesn’t hold much value as a commercial product; however,
ecologically it appears to have been a vital component in fostering the
fertility of the grasslands. Looking specifically at the African
grasslands, evidence points to the fact the mobility of herds fostered a
rich grassland ecosystem by consuming nutrients from across the plain,
only to deposit concentrated amounts of shit into corralled areas during
the night. The benefits of those habits are still detectable from as
long as 3,000 years ago <sup>[\[3\]](#3)</sup>.

All of that might be interesting, but how does that matter to Dogecoin?
Dogecoin, as well as other decentralized ledger technologies, are very
unique technologies, whose growth and networks more closely resemble a
collection of cells that works together to create a living organism,
than it does a corporate entity or financial product. If we choose to
acknowledge these technologies as complex multi-cellular organisms, then
it is important that we step out of the Darwinist framework that is
often used when discussing market competition. In a pure competition,
winner take all, framework for discussing these technologies, the
desired end goal is for one technology to hold all of the value – with
the value from all the others going to zero. This thinking works for
corporations, as the actions of only a handful of actors in the
corporation can often determine the outcome of all actors in the
corporation.

That’s not the case for Dogecoin. While a corporation going under acts
as both a financial death as well as a functional death, there is
nothing binding the function of Dogecoin to its financial value. As long
as there is a desire, someone can, and likely will continue to operate
the network. Exchanges can delist it, third party vendors can stop
supporting it, but the technology can continue to function regardless as
long as there is someone willing to run a node. This allows the
technology of Dogecoin to die as organically as it grew.

This creates a large problem, if corporate actors are the reason for the
massive investment in Dogecoin, then opaque actions taken by these
corporate actors can just as well drive investment out of Dogecoin. This
would bring on a financial death that they would have the foresight to
anticipate. If is important that there exists an ability for Dogecoin to
die a organic financial death – a death not where a handful of cells are
able to take massive amounts of value for their own gain, leaving all
other cells with nothing in return – rather a death in which the value
of the system are returned to the broader ecosystem, supporting the next
organic technological evolution.

Insert Dogeshit. A first of kind experiment where Dogecoin can always be
exchanged for an equal amount of Dogeshit, but not the other way around.
When Dogecoin is exchanged for Dogeshit, it is burned and removed from
circulation. But why burn the Dogecoin? Why not allow Dogeshit to be
exchanged back to Dogecoin? Well, just as the original nutrients vital
to the fertility of the grassland ecosystem couldn’t be converted from
shit back to the plants they came from, Dogeshit shouldn’t be able to
easily able to converted back to Dogecoin for the benefit of the greater
blockchain technology ecosystem. I call this process **digestion**.

## Distribution Fairness

Besides the symbolism, this digestion process was chosen as a method to
promote fairness over the initial distribution of Dogeshit. When a new
token is created, it’s common to see the account that deploys the token
mint an amount and allocate it all to themselves. Then it is distributed
through some form of presale, airdrop, or a self funded liquidity pool.
All of these methods give a large amount of control, and oftentimes a
massive financial windfall to the developer. This process is not
necessarily malicious, but it relies on the trust of the initial
developer. This ability to control such a large portion of the tokens
can lead to the infamous behavior known as **‘rug-pulling’** – when
someone who controls a massive amount of the token supply sells their
tokens on the market<sup>[\[4\]](#4)</sup>. Since the token holder had
basically no vested financial risk in their position, this behavior can
completely undermine the value of the token at the expense of those who
chose to invest in the project.

This is not how Dogeshit works. There are only 2 ways that Dogeshit is
minted:

1.  When Dogecoin is digested into Dogeshit.
2.  As staking rewards that are distributed to those who chose to lock
    their Dogeshit in the staking contract.

Instead of the unfair advantage being allocated to myself simply for
writing some code, the only advantage that has been created is for those
who either:

1.  Already own Dogecoin.
2.  Digest Dogecoin into Dogeshit and stake it.

Just as Dogecoin was released with no premine, it is essential that any
evolution to Dogecoin is released with no premint. It is also essential
that the community that formed around and supported Dogecoin isn’t
forced into competition with a new token just because it is on a new
blockchain. No matter the price of Dogeshit, even if it is worth more
than Dogecoin, Dogecoin can always be digested into Dogeshit. This
choice was made to avoid creating any ‘fear of missing out’. The goal of
Dogeshit is to allow Dogecoin owners time to choose to migrate over if
they wish. Blockchain technologies are complicated; it is important that
Dogecoin owners can have time to evaluate their choice and not feel
pressured to digest their Dogecoin before they feel comfortable with the
choice.

## Staking Rewards – nice.

To reward the early adopters who are some of the first to digest their
Dogecoin into Dogeshit, Dogeshit will emit staking rewards on a schedule
that mimics the mining reward payout schedule of Dogecoin.

Dogecoin initially rewarded miners a random amount between 0 and
1,000,000 DOGE per block. This was designed to halve 5 times after a
little more than 69 days before rewarding a fixed 10,000 DOGE per block
until a supply cap of 100 billion DOGE was
reached<sup>[\[5\]](#5)</sup>. This meant that, the expected date,
assuming a truly random distribution should have stopped rewarding
miners after less than a year and a half, sometime around June 2015. It
turned out that this wasn’t the case, and the 100 billion supply cap was
never enforced, so after the mining rewards moved to the fixed 10,000
DOGE, Dogecoin continued to reward 10,000 DOGE per block
indefinitely<sup>[\[6\]](#6)</sup>.

This rewards schedule looks as such:

| Block   | Days Since First Block | Rewards Per Block (DOGE) | Expected Supply (DOGE) |
| ------- | ---------------------- | ------------------------ | ---------------------- |
| 1       | 0                      | 0 - 1,000,000            | 0                      |
| 100,001 | 69                     | 0 - 500,000              | 50 B                   |
| 200,001 | 138                    | 0 - 250,000              | 75 B                   |
| 300,001 | 208                    | 0 - 125,000              | 87.5 B                 |
| 400,001 | 277                    | 0 - 62,500               | 93.75 B                |
| 500,001 | 347                    | 0 - 31,250               | 96.875 B               |
| 600,001 | 416                    | 10,000                   | 98.4375 B              |

Dogeshit was designed to mint 69 billion dSHT in a similar time frame to
the initial Dogecoin staking rewards before it reached a constant 10,000
DOGE per block.

| Block       | Days Since First Block | Rewards Per Block (dSHT) | Total Rewards Distributed (dSht) |
| ----------- | ---------------------- | ------------------------ | -------------------------------- |
| 1           | 0                      | 9696                     | 0                                |
| 3,000,001   | 69                     | 6969                     | 29.088 B                         |

Instead of running expensive specialized hardware like you have to mine
Dogecoin, anyone who owns dSHT can stake it. Staking rewards are
distributed proportionally, meaning that if you have staked 50% of the
total amount staked, then if it were in the first 3,000,000 blocks, you
would receive 4848 dSHT per block.

## Energy Usage, Speed, and Transaction Fees

### Why Litecoin

Dogecoin’s core technologies are a fork of Luckycoin, a now defunct fork
of Litecoin. Currently, Dogecoin and Litecoin are merged mined, meaning
that miners can utilize the same work to mine Litecoin and Dogecoin
simultaneously. This initial choice of forking off of Litecoin was based
on the fact that Litecoin had faster and cheaper transactions and that
at the time, it could still be mined on consumer GPUs. At this point,
Bitcoin mining was already controlled by ASICs, expensive custom chips
designed with the sole purpose of mining Bitcoin. At the time, this
meant Dogecoin was the one of the most accessible ways of interacting
with blockchain technologies, both as a user and a miner. Unfortunately,
by June of 2014, ASIC miners capable of mining both Litecoin and
Dogecoin had hit the market, meaning the Dogecoin mining operations
shared the same prohibitive entry costs as Bitcoin.

The initial design choices to base Dogecoin off of Litecoin were well
intentioned, but unfortunately, were made moot by technological
progression. While the cost of using Dogecoin remained low, the cost of
effectively participating in the network became inaccessible to a
general audience.

### Current Dogecoin Metrics

We’re going to look at 4 important metrics when evaluating the current
Dogecoin network. Each of these play an important role in what makes a
blockchain technology scalable and usable in day to day transactions.

  - Transactions per Second
  - Finality Time
  - Transaction Cost
  - Network Energy Usage

#### Transactions per Second (TPS)

The number of transactions that can be processed per second. This number
is important, but not as vital as it might seem. The big issue with a
low TPS comes from spikes of high demand. For reference Visa claims to
be able to handle up to 24,000 transactions per second, but it only
appears to average around 1,700 transactions per second. Paypal handles
on average 190 transactions per second, but can handle up to 1000
transactions per second during peak periods.

Dogecoin can handle a maximum of **68** transactions per second. This
can be calculated by the following:

<br> ![Equation
1](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?%5Cfrac%7B%5Ctextrm%7BBlockSizeLimit%7D%7D%7B%5Ctextrm%7BMinimumTransactionSize%7D%5Ctimes%5Ctextrm%7BBlockTime%7D%7D%3D%5Cfrac%7B1024%5E%7B2%7D%5Censuremath%7B%5C%2C%5Cmathrm%7BBytes%7D%7D%7D%7B257%5Censuremath%7B%5C%2C%5Cmathrm%7BBytes%7D%7D%5Ctimes60%5Censuremath%7B%5C%2C%5Cmathrm%7Bseconds%7D%7D%7D%5Capprox68%5Censuremath%7B%5C%2C%5Cmathrm%7BTPS%7D%7D)
<br>

#### Finality Time

Finality time describes how long it takes to be sure that the result of
a transaction is final. Unfortunately, Dogecoin, as well as Litecoin and
Bitcoin, a transaction can never truly be finalized. Instead these
protocols rely on a number of additional blocks to verify that the given
transaction remains in the longest chain. 6 confirmations is generally
what wallet software uses, but exchanges can often require significantly
more. Kraken requires 40 confirmations, and Coinbase requires 60
confirmations. Each one of these confirmations takes a minute, so the
effective time for a Dogecoin transaction to clear can range from **6-60
minutes** depending upon the context.

#### Transaction Cost

The transaction fee represents how much it costs to send Dogecoin,
regardless of amount. In 2021 the median transaction fee for Dogecoin
peaked at just over **\![Inline
Equation 1](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?inline%26space%3B1.25%2A%2Apertransaction%2Candnowcurrentlyhoversaround%2A%2A%5C)0.34**
(October 2021).

#### Network Energy Usage
